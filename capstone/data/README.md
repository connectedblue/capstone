Here you'll store your raw data files. If they are encoded in a supported file format, they'll automatically be loaded when you call `load.project()`.

Raw coursera data is Coursera-SwiftKey.zip, downloaded from project site.

Each raw variable is defined and loaded in a seperate R file with the name of the variable the same as the file name (so that it is auto cached when load.project() is run)
