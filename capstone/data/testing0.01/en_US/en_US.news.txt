The glistening court beckoned. As Bowie filed onto the hardwood behind 26-year-old guard/stand-up comedian Terry Hosley, general manager John Wolfe — a man with admittedly no basketball experience — looked on from the sideline. Coach Bob Topp, who spent much of the day working 15 miles down the road as a middle-school athletic director, rolled a half-dozen basketballs underneath the hoop with the help of his college-age daughter. Players continued to trickle in, some wearing the business wear of their 9-to-5 existences.
The first came toward the end of the 2010 season, when he hit himself on the helmet with his bat in frustration after striking out in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays.
So, while the USGA is stedfast on its insistence that Trump National-Bedminster’s selection as the host for a U.S. Women’s Open is just that — the door appears to be cracked a little bit more now. And that’s all Trump has asked for.

Although one can almost never go wrong with fresh-cut fries, I subbed them out for the house potato salad, which proved another good choice. Cool and creamy, with intriguing, smoky notes, it was not long for my plate.
"When you look how we ended the season, once we got Baron, he seemed to galvanize the team and we started playing more like a team. You put a healthy Anderson in there, and a healthy Jamison, and you're pretty competitive.

In the near future, science develops a way to make people stop aging at 25. Pretty sweet, except that everyone is also genetically engineered to only live one more year. They can buy more time, allowing the rich go on living at 25 indefinably, while everyone else's clock runs out. Justin Timberlake plays a man accused of murder, who then sets out to shake up the system, with a hostage Amanda Seyfried in tow. Though, pretty sure Timberlake turned 30 this year...

Every time things get horrifying, though, we cut back to the tech wizards who are orchestrating the whole experience. The “scares” are therefore “ironic” and, being safely cordoned off behind these “quotation marks,” aren’t scary. While some of the one-liners are funny, the only reason I could think of to keep watching is to learn what the overarching reason behind the setup might be. When this answer is delivered, though, it’s weak, and it is given in the clunkiest possible way: A new character simply walks onscreen and explains the back story. Worse: It’s a celebrity cameo. Worse still: The “reveal” nullifies everything the protagonists have been trying to do.
The roasted-malt character of this almost-black schwarzbier displays itself with a cocoa-powder aroma. The flavor, however, is not nearly as roasty as the color suggests. The beer's lager yeast, pilsner malt and German hops combine to create a clean-tasting beer with a crisp, dry finish. If you've been fooled by the misconception that dark equals heavy, this beer will set you straight. Available on draft at the brewery and several bars and restaurants around town. At 4.4 percent ABV, you could drink several Black Lagers on St. Patrick's Day.
Children are repeatedly encased in pressurized oxygen chambers normally used after scuba diving accidents. This unproven therapy is meant to reduce inflammation that experts say is little understood and may even be beneficial.
Sarah: During lunch with Ben’s family, Lindzi was so nervous and kept dropping everything, which made me like her more. I really hope Ben doesn’t pick her because she deserves better. Ben’s sister cornered her and grilled her about Courtney rather than getting to know Lindzi better. Julia hasn’t met Courtney yet and already doesn’t like her!

"Rickey Henderson is the best player I've ever played with, and when it comes to stealing bases, he's got Rickey Henderson-type speed," Stewart said. "He's got Frank Thomas-type power. He would be in a class of big power hitters.
Why it makes sense: Owner Woody Johnson is a big thinker and has a past record of taking chances with veteran quarterbacks in these kinds of situations, not to mention the Jets are a team still built to win now. Also, there are the trust and leadership issues that have been bouncing around the offense, and no one would quiet the masses like Peyton Manning, one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.
Even though prospective jurors answered 110 questions in writing in advance, the selection process dragged out over six days as dozens of people were questioned individually in U.S. District Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer's courtroom.

Hey, Ted: Flynn must be thoroughly evaluated. Here's what I don't like about him: 1. His size and arm strength are not much different from McCoy's. 2. I'm not sure how much he can lift a mediocre team -- a requirement of a true franchise quarterback. I believe his surrounding cast has lifted him. 3. You just never know how a backup will react when he is elevated to the starting job and all the responsibility falls on him. These concerns don't disqualify him, in my opinion, but allaying them would take a lot of research. I do agree if the Browns could find their quarterback outside the draft, they could really make some hay in the draft developing a supporting cast.
There have always been women in rock -- does anyone rock harder than Janis Joplin or Tina Turner? -- but it wasn't until punk and indie-rock came along that female rockers came into their own.
GARFIELD HEIGHTS, Ohio - Garfield Heights' Bulldog hockey program won two championships at the South Bend Cup Tournament.
The documents provide a fuller picture of the NYPD's unapologetic approach to protecting the city from terrorism. Eisenstein said he believes that at least one document, the summary of statements about the Danish cartoons, showed that the NYPD is not following a court order that prohibits police from compiling records on people who are simply exercising their First Amendment rights.

“He is the 40th young man Pitman has lost over the years in various wars,” said Campbell. “I don’t know if another town our size has taken a bigger hit. It’s so upsetting. I served in Korea and every loss is like a punch in the gut. I want to stop putting monuments to our young people up in the park.”
Because of employee turnover, it behooves a hotel to keep training in the fore. And it behooves the customer to ask and ask and ask again about accessibility features just to be sure. Should it be this way? No. But until the world understands, some of the education process belongs to the customer. And then the customer can impress upon hoteliers that he or she will give business only to those places that go to the head of the class.

"If your plans for athletics don't work out you need to have a back-up plan. You can't accomplish anything without having a strong education. Plus if you are a good athlete that means you are discipline and most likely you will be discipline in the classroom as well."

Triplett rattles off the stories in a matter-of-fact tone: Her grandson once got caught in the middle of a gun battle in broad daylight while riding his bike; she had to demolish her garage to keep the drug dealers from using it to peddle their product; a neighbor's windows were smashed with bricks because the home was mistaken for a drug house; drug dealers have stripped their rivals' cars and left them on the street; she had to fence in her yard because drug seekers would mistakenly try to come through her back door.
Some are concerned that OCN represents an advocacy site and not a news service. Oregonian Editor Peter Bhatia wrote on Sunday that we have vetted their coverage. OCN is clearly a news model that we haven’t seen before here in Oregon. It seems only fitting that a project like ONN should take a close look at it. Ultimately, their reporting will have to speak for itself.
On the other hand, when retailers close stores and lay off workers, that hurts their customer service scores because shoppers report that there are fewer workers around to help them and that "I was waiting in line longer than I usually do," VanAmburg said.

The February 2012 Board of Education vote to approve the final version of the sale contract was again unanimous. Now at last the fun and exciting work can begin to restore this historic house, to interpret the lives of local 18th Century people and to promote knowledge of conflicts with Britain which led some American colonists to declare independence while others remained loyal in 1776. The 1759 Vought House non-profit corporation is eager to meet this new challenge and to expand our educational partnership with the Clinton Township school district in the years ahead.”
"I'd like to say I was courageous, but honestly it was terrifying," Booker said. He said he feared he wasn't going to make it out alive, and called it a "come to Jesus moment."
The OTS conducted the review in March and interviewed 733 car drivers and 560 motorcyclists.
Of course, it's precisely in these desperate moments that things become most fascinating, because we have no choice but to set our preconceptions aside. "I'm interested," Weschler says, "in what it's like when people or places suddenly catch fire." This can be an aesthetic process or it can be political, or, as in the case of "Vermeer in Bosnia," it can be both. It's also a pretty good description of Weschler's own approach to writing, which is, by turns, literary and journalistic, an idiosyncratic mix of the reported and the inferred.

Beautifully intricate necklaces showcase attention to detail, as well as fantastically original designs. Animals populate the galleries, from flattened gold bats to bird-shaped pendants, lizards and slithery snakes. Nearly all of the artifacts in "Sacred Gold" were created between 500 B.C. and 1700 A.D. and are well preserved.
"I had a conversation at recess one day with a girl who was new to our school," said Mary Mayfield, the School 90 teacher. "She said, 'You know how it's really easy to get in trouble here? At my old school it was really hard to get in trouble.' It's because we care so much. We're on them."

Annie is as engaging as she is generous, full of opinions earned by living life at full throttle, even when she was scared to death. And that is a crucial truth about Annie Glenn. Americans rightly "ooh" and "ahh" over John Glenn's courage in space, but let us never forget the hero of a wife who gave her public blessing, and then privately prayed until his safe return.

Ameer Gado, one of Allen's attorneys, noted Friday that Koster did not dispute the new evidence - just how it should be applied.
The renaissance of Shaker Square as a food destination seems to be in full swing. Chef Sergio Abramof's Sarava anchors the culinary delights to be found on the northeast quadrant. Inspired by the flavors of the chef's native Brazil, Sarava's cuisine fills a rare niche on the local dining scene. Traditional dishes such as feijoada (a rich black-bean stew with sausage and pork) and xim xim(a slow-braised stew of chicken, shrimp, coconut milk and peppers) are as authentically exotic to our palates as they are satisfyingly homey. The "street plates" are where the menu really shines. It's easy to fill a table, tapas-style, with dishes such as tamale cakes, artichoke fritters, chicken passarinho (pan-seared chicken morsels in a garlic-scallion sauce). The substantial and spicy stewed calamari plate is practically a meal in itself. Sarava also delivers a sexy and foreign-seeming atmosphere, especially in the dimly lit, high-ceilinged bar area. South American beats provide the perfect soundtrack for sipping a caipirinha cocktail and nibbling the night away.
Again it's appropriate because under London, Ubuntu continues to provide an alternative view of how good vegetarian cuisine can be.

In some cases, the directors gave their stars confidence.

The 33,000-square-foot building, set back from Hawthorne by a parking lot, will be replaced by a 54,000-square-foot structure built to the sidewalk over an underground parking lot. At that size, it will be bigger than the Safeway at Southeast Cesar E. Chavez and Powell boulevards.

Striking at an opponent without intending to annihilate his ability to resist (by either conventional or unconventional means) is like waterskiing without skiis. What seems a way to save trouble and expense and keep our options open, is a formula for getting in over our heads, whether we're talking Cuba and Vietnam or Afghanistan and Libya.
Brickowski said he's studied the parallels between retired athletes and retired military personnel. "I had a high-ranking military officer tell me, 'The higher the ranking, the more difficult the transition.' And that's the same with professional basketball.

One of the best appetizers is the Napoleon ($10) that features layers of sage polenta, tomato confit, eggplant, zucchini, red pepper piperade and a cap of goat cheese, all molded in a cylinder. It's kind of a New Age ratatouille; the fresh flavors evoke the Provencal countryside.
Dessert find of the year: Bread pudding at EaT: An Oyster Bar. Bread pudding is sometimes more likely to sink you than a certain iceberg that brought down a certain ship.

Sajid recently handed out campaign brochures after a popular weekly prayer service at the mosque.

He has sent more than 900 brochures through the mail and hopes to follow up with calls during his lunch breaks.
Beane and the A's, however, should expect nothing but Ramirez's best effort. Earning just enough money to keep his million-dollar shoes polished this season, Ramirez should use every at-bat in 2012 as a public audition for any American League teams looking for a designated hitter next season.

That was as far as he got. Manning's voice broke. His head dropped. Emotion flooded the remainder of his remarks: "The only professional football I've known is Colts football. Our team won a lot of games here. I played with so many great teammates here and I've been part of a great organization here, an organization and an owner who I respect and continue to respect.
Tressel wasnt surviving this. There was no way. He blatantly lied to his superiors and NCAA investigators, breaching explicit terms of his contract. But Tressel became leverage for the university with the NCAA. His bosses defiantly stood by him. Forcing out a coach they so staunchly supported just weeks earlier  and who was so successful against the Buckeyes arch enemy  sends another signal to the NCAA that Ohio State is sternly policing itself, purging the program of the root of the compliance problems.

I also have high hopes for “Moonrise Kingdom” (May 25), Wes Anderson’s follow-up to “Fantastic Mr. Fox,” and Woody Allen’s latest stop on his Euro-concert tour, “To Rome with Love (June 22). Ditto for “Lawless” (Aug. 31), a Weinstein release directed by Aussie John Hillcoat (“The Proposition”), with Tom Hardy, Jessica Chastain, Gary Oldman and others, and “Premium Rush” (Aug. 24), featuring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a Manhattan bike messenger being pursued across the city by a dirty cop. As a big-city bicyclist who’s taken some spills, I look forward to this. I’ll wear my helmet.

Fifty red dots beeped on Thornton’s radar. They were all converging to Pier 11 downtown. But out of his glass cabin he could see nothing.

It seems ridiculous that after seven years of producing and debating bridge replacement proposals, this would happen. After all, it doesn't take an engineer to determine what the clearance needs to be: You figure out how high the Columbia usually sits, how much airspace planes require in that location and how many feet it takes to ship large loads up or down the river.
After a brief boom in the aftermath of the movie's initial release, visits to Halifax's Maritime Museum and the city's Titanic cemeteries slowed from a torrent to a trickle, many Haligonians say.

Sales varied dramatically around the country. The best performance was in the West, where sales rose more than 15 percent from February. The worst turnout was in the Northeast, where sales sank more than 32 percent. They were unchanged in the South, and down nearly 8 percent in the Midwest.
But it is inaccurate to frame this debate as simply another battle between those who care about the environment and those who want to exploit it. The environmentalists who tout wind energy and other relatively green sources of energy point out that we are producing and consuming energy in such a manner as to throw the globe's human and ecological future into doubt. Runte appears to believe that to acknowledge this amounts to giving "everything called 'renewable' ... a pass." I worry that his argument amounts to giving everything deemed "scenic" a pass while ignoring or minimizing the dire threats posed to humans and non-humans by our reckless levels of consumption.

Maybe the larger problem is his point of view. He begins his article by criticizing the festival's mission "to break the barriers of stereotypes" because the lineup does "not actively push that agenda" because of (in part) our film about mariachi music. Maybe he doesn't realize mariachi is the national music of Mexico? By that rationalization, every American film with jazz or the blues must conform to stereotype. I think he's confusing breaking stereotypes with something else. Just because a Mexican plays mariachi music doesn't make them a stereotype. Just like a Chicagoan playing the blues doesn't equate stereotype. What is stereotypical, is an American assuming that every Mexican holiday is Cinco de Mayo.We would appreciate it if Mr. Stamets could rethink his (admittedly brief) comments about our film and his view of Chicago Latino Film Festival's mission and lineup in a context that maybe he isn't (as of yet) qualified to make them.

Depending on how you count, "Arrietty" is either the fourth or fifth film based on the classic children's book about smallness, "The Borrowers," and in spirit, it is a fairly faithful rendition of Mary Norton's 1952 novel. The story concerns 6-inch-high people who live a secret existence underneath the floorboards of a country home. They are called "Borrowers" because they borrow (blotting paper for rugs, postage stamps for wall paintings, chess pieces for statuary) from the big people upstairs, a race of conventionally sized folks they call "human beans."

Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega highlighted his Christian faith during his re-election bid last year, when his campaign rallies were accompanied by religious processions, chants and the campaign slogan "Christian, Socialist and In Solidarity."

In the play, one of the conspiring reporters works for the Rocky Mountain News, though no evidence exists that the paper played any part in the scheme. But doing so allows Suh to exploit one of the longest newspaper rivalries in history, ending with the News' closure in 2009. You needn't have been alive in 1907 to know how intensely these papers feuded. But that year, Bonfils' enmity for News owner Thomas Patterson spilled out into the streets near the state Capitol. In the spirit of a Wild West duel, Bonfils attacked Patterson, who had called Bonfils a blackmailer in a News cartoon. When the teetering News was bought by Cincinnati media company Scripps-Howard and merged with The Express in 1926, Roy Howard spit, "We believe that a dictatorship of Denver's newspaper field by The Denver Post would be nothing less than a blight."

As a rule, couture houses are secretive about their clientele. Purchasing a custom-made, five-figure piece of clothing comes with the gift of discretion, a rare commodity in our publicity-crazed world. But executives describe many of their new clients as relatively young working women—doctors, lawyers, executives—who spend their own salaries, often on daywear and not merely for special occasions like weddings and black-tie galas. One of Valentino's recent couture clients, for example, is an equestrian enthusiast who wanted a bespoke jacket to wear with her riding pants.

As America's gas supply grows this summer, the industry will be looking for ways to push levels back down and prices back up. Major natural gas producers such as Chesapeake Energy Corp. and ConocoPhillips already have slowed down the flow of gas from their fields.

I'd like to see Oregon take the weakest part of its waiver application -- say, the part about English language learners -- and turn it into a blockbuster. Oregon could become nationally renowned as a state that turns those "hard-to-teach" students into bilingual college graduates, by enlisting everyone from preschool teachers on up and by ending the financial incentive to teach English slowly. Tackling this one challenge would pay dividends for all students, because it would require Oregon to be more strategic, more creative and less defensive about virtually every aspect of K-12 education.

My knees hurt, I'm on the road away from my family, I'm a bit grumpy, feeling sorry for myself, poor me. And halfway through, I'm starting to have fun, to warm up, and then I have this epiphany, "You stupid old man, you're doing what you love, shut up and skate and just enjoy this." And so the second half, no more thoughts, just music and dance. A coat comes from the ceiling, I put on my tails, a hat comes from the audience and a man throws me my cane, and I go crazy and have a good time. And then my thoughts come back for the bow. And the bow is really silly. "I love bowing. I'm no Scott Hamilton, but I'm not bad." And it's a really fun program to do. I love props and I love hats. I'm addicted to them.

Most oil-packed tuna in the U.S. is packed in soybean oil. Going back a few decades, somebody whispered to someone else that oil adds unnecessary fat and calories, so many people choose tuna in water. That's not a bad idea, according to the American Institute for Cancer Research. It notes that albacore tuna has the most healthy omega-3s of any canned tuna. Because oil and water do not mix, they also remain better in the fish so are less apt to be drained away in other oil. Four major health organizations recommend eating seafood twice a week for the benefits of omega-3s.
